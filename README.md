# Studio Glyphic

Welcome to Studio Glyphic, a small indie game development team that creates immersive gaming experiences. Our team consists of four individuals who work on game development in their free time. We are excited to announce that our first game in development is a turn-based autobattler card game.

## About the Game

Our first game is a turn-based autobattler card game set in the world of Glyphic. Players will be immersed in a fantasy world full of magical creatures, epic battles, and mythical artifacts. We are focused on creating an engaging gameplay experience that is easy to learn but difficult to master. Our game is designed to appeal to both casual and hardcore gamers.

## Our Slogan

Our slogan for now is "[tbd slogan]" We want players to feel fully immersed in the world we have created and to lose themselves in the gameplay experience.

## Our Team

Our team consists of four individuals who are passionate about game development. We are committed to creating high-quality games that offer unique and engaging gameplay experiences. We work on our games in our free time and are dedicated to making our vision a reality.

## Our Goals

One of our goals is to interconnect the story of all games in some way. Some games may be loosely connected, while others may be directly connected. We want to create a rich and immersive world that players can explore through our games.
